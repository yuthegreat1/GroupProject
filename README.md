## Project Description/Outline:
We choose to analyze netflix originals because we wanted to compare the content that netflix makes compared to the content it hosts. We are all netflix watchers and curious about what's going to perform well. With netflix stock decreasing we want to see whether the influx of original content can improve netflix and stop its stock from decreasing. 
## Inital Questions:
    1. How does netflix's original content compare to content that netflix only hosts?
    2. How well does netflix's original content compare to the content being produced by other streaming companies like hulu or HBO?
    3. How well does the netflix originals do by language?
